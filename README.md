# CPSC 210 Project

## UBC Rate My Libraries

This project is intended for UBC students to share insights about libraries at which they
feel most comfortable to study. The purpose of building this project is to offer freshmen and
new ubc students ideas of different learning styles they could embrace in different areas. 
From what I experienced and what I heard from the first year student, people often struggle to
find a best place that suits their needs for commuting 
and accessing learning tools such as printers,
chargers, or publicly shared equipments like the muted piano located in Irving K Library
second floor, water station and so on. 

The project piqued my interest as I have never seen a website on the internet
that has put together student's feelings and suggestions for libraries. What people often
focus on when talking about library is what books they provide. However, most
students come to the library to study rather than reaching the top of the shelves
for careful research. From what I experienced this year as a first-year student, different
studying space can yield completely different outcomes and concentration levels. Therefore,
I am committed to create this software interface to minimize obstacles students
may have through their transition to the university of british columbia.


## As a *user*, you may do the following:
- check out previous comments I made so far for each library with user's unique key linked to each comment
- add comments with ratings for every library with their current date and time associated with their comments
- remove comments with ratings for each library commented after key/password validation
- view the list of libraries and list of comments inside the libraries
- quit RateMyLibrary entirely
- when I quit the application menu, I want to be reminded whether to save my comments as files inside RateMyLibrary.
- when I start the application, I will be given the option to load my historical comments so everything is up-to-date.


## Instructions for Grader:
- You can generate the first required action related to adding Xs to a Y by clicking on "Add" button on the bottom left

- You can locate my visual component such as Vancouver's gif at the right panel when you load my application
- You can save the state of Rate My Library by closing my application window and clicking on "Save" on a separate pop-up window
